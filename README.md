# Section D

In this section I have recorded a video that covers the following questions: 

1. What is your experience as a developer?
2. What is your experience as an educator?
3. Working remotely, how do you deal with power and connectivity outages? Do you have a backup system?

You can find my video answering the above questions here: https://www.loom.com/share/c5a94fe7e32344618934abc8406f3e76
